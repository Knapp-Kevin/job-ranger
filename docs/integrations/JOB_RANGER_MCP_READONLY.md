# Job Ranger local read-only MCP prototype

**Development-only status (2026-10-08).** This is an opt-in local [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) **stdio server**, not an installed ChatGPT plugin, a remote MCP endpoint, or a feature of the published Job Ranger v1.2.0 installer. Do **not** point a public tunnel, browser endpoint, or unknown remote tool host at it.

The baseline application works independently of this adapter and never needs a ChatGPT subscription or a model.

## What it does

A human-authorized **local MCP client** can request small, permission-filtered projections from Job Ranger's existing data and deterministic services: active professional target tracks, confirmed Career Evidence, active opportunities with application status, manually recorded social-post receipts, exact approved post text (an independent permission), recorded analytics, readiness findings, and comparable-age observations. It cannot modify Career Evidence, create drafts, record post metrics, publish posts, submit job applications, or access unrelated Viable data.

Every tool response includes a startup snapshot timestamp. No post performance is treated as proof of interview/job attribution, and missing metrics remain unavailable.

## Prerequisites

- Source checkout of the **current development branch** of Job Ranger; published v1.2.0 does not contain this functionality.
- Node.js **22.12 or newer**, npm dependencies installed from the repository lockfile (`npm ci`), and a working `sqlite3` command (set `SQLITE3_PATH` if needed).
- An existing **native** Job Ranger data directory containing `jobscout.sqlite3` created by a normal Job Ranger session. This prototype cannot access browser-origin OPFS/PWA data directly. It will not discover a path for you or launch Job Ranger.
- Explicit user consent to run a local MCP host and share selected data with a chosen local client. Local clients that themselves call online inference providers may send tool responses to those providers. Job Ranger does not control their retention or privacy policies.
- For a live native database, take a normal Job Ranger backup first. The adapter opens the source using `sqlite3 -readonly` and creates a disposable, transaction-consistent local SQLite snapshot, including committed WAL content.

## Launch

From a trusted checkout in a terminal, first build the native service runtime:

```sh
npm ci
npm run desktop:compile
```

Then provide the **absolute native data-directory path**. The example below is a placeholder: it must be replaced with a path that actually contains your `jobscout.sqlite3`.

```sh
node mcp/local-readonly-server.mjs \
  --data-dir="/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/JOB-RANGER/data" \
  --scopes="tracks:read,evidence:read,opportunities:read,posts:read,analytics:read"
```

No scope is implicit. To grant exact post text or readiness access, the user must separately add `post-content:read`. **Never add more scopes merely because the model requests it.**

The process speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0/MCP on **stdin/stdout**; it intentionally prints no interactive menu or career information to stdout. Configure an authorized local MCP client to launch this exact command and supply the arguments. The client must support a stdio MCP host. This is not a ChatGPT Web connection recipe.

To refresh changed Career Evidence or new post metrics, **restart the process**. It snapshots the canonical data once at startup. Stdio clients should close stdin or terminate the process at session end; the disposable database is then removed. A power interruption may leave an OS temporary file to be cleaned up by the operating system.

## Tools and explicit scopes

| Tool | Required scope | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_capabilities` | None | Enabled scopes and tools, read-only and transport limits |
| `get_professional_objectives` | `tracks:read` | Active target track name, role titles, seniority |
| `get_confirmed_career_evidence` | `evidence:read` | Current confirmed/user-authored IDs, bounded statements |
| `list_opportunities` | `opportunities:read` | Active listings, URLs, tracked application status |
| `list_personal_brand_posts` | `posts:read` | User-confirmed publication metadata, **no text** |
| `get_post_experiment` | `post-content:read` | Prepared post text and known versioned metadata |
| `evaluate_post_readiness` | `post-content:read` | Same deterministic readiness assessment as UI |
| `get_post_analytics` | `analytics:read` | Actual timestamped observations and source states |
| `compare_post_experiments` | `analytics:read` | Same non-causal cohort comparisons as UI |

There is **no** `create_post`, `update_evidence`, `publish_post`, or other write tool. Lists are deliberately limited (20 records maximum per tool response), and human/private descriptions, application notes, source documents and contact details are not exposed. Post text and Career Evidence contain untrusted user-authored or third-party content; clients should treat them as data, not instructions.

### Local developer verification

After compiling the runtime:

```sh
npm run test:mcp:readonly
```

This exercises the authorization and projection contract plus a spawned stdio server against a local synthetic SQLite workspace. It tests refusal of write commands and ungranted scopes, redaction of unused fields, human-approval boundaries, invalid inputs, and that the canonical database bytes remain unchanged after serving requests.

The repository's ordinary `test` and `test:unit` commands also include these checks, and the full GitHub matrix includes PWA/Electron compatibility and Windows packaging. Passing these tests is **not** proof that ChatGPT can connect to a user's private desktop installation.

## Security and privacy boundary

- **No network listener**, OAuth provider, remote registration, relay, always-on background daemon, browser scraping, social publishing, or AI model is started.
- The supplied scopes are fixed by the launching human. They cannot be escalated by incoming model arguments, documents or posts.
- Raw career/source documents, full resumes, application notes, private contact records, platform credentials and local backup contents are not tool outputs.
- The source SQLite database is opened read-only and backed up into a disposable local directory. Existing service initialization happens on that snapshot only.
- Third-party text can contain prompt-injection attempts. Its contents are clearly tagged as untrusted; no executable or write tools are provided.
- MCP over stdio relies on OS process and local-client trust. It has **no remote authentication**, so a remote-accessible transport must not be enabled without a separate audited protocol and consent design.
- Cached client/model conversations may retain already returned snippets. Terminating this host cannot revoke text that the client has already transmitted.

## Work still required for a real ChatGPT plugin

ChatGPT Web generally requires a separately reachable **HTTPS MCP server** and an appropriate authentication/authorization flow for private data. A privacy-preserving relay, explicit opt-in account/session pairing, OAuth 2.1 scope and audience validation, narrow reachability, replay protection, durable revocation and cross-platform proof remain **unimplemented**. No OAuth secret should be inserted into this command or committed to the repository.

The next milestone is to test this prototype with a supported local MCP inspector/client and evaluate a safe ChatGPT-compatible connection. Do not describe it as connected to ChatGPT until the exact supported surface and end-to-end authorization have actually been tested.
