# Universal User Stories

**Implementation program:** #81 — completed  
**Contract status:** normative and maintained

## Purpose

Job Ranger should work across materially different career paths without requiring the product to know what a “normal” career looks like.

The product contract is expressed through **user stories**. Career archetypes and synthetic personas are validation fixtures only. They exist to expose hidden assumptions, not to define separate versions of Job Ranger.

The original implementation issues (#82 through #88) are now historical ownership/provenance. Future changes to these stories should be tracked through new issues rather than reopening completed tranche issues merely to reuse their numbers.

## North-star user story

> **US-0:** As a job seeker, I want Job Ranger to adapt to the way my career works without requiring me to understand how Job Ranger works.

## Governing rules

1. Career Profile owns broad intent/preferences, not factual career history.
2. Target Tracks own per-direction search intent and constraint strength.
3. Career Evidence owns factual career history and provenance.
4. Applications own the search lifecycle.
5. Parsers, discovery providers, and inference providers may propose information; they do not establish factual truth.
6. Core workflows remain useful without inference.
7. Unknown information remains unknown rather than becoming an arbitrary negative or positive signal.
8. Hard constraints and preferences have different semantics.
9. Occupation-specific concepts may extend the universal core through bounded vocabularies/rules, but must not fork the product into occupation-specific applications.
10. Universality must not be implemented as an unbounded entity/attribute/value schema that erases meaning.
11. Consequential external actions remain under user authority.

## User-story catalog

### Start from whatever I have

#### US-1 — Resume-first onboarding

As a job seeker with an existing resume, I want to import it so Job Ranger can build an initial evidence set without making me retype my career history.

Implementation provenance: #82 plus the Career Evidence import architecture from #59.

#### US-2 — No-resume onboarding

As a job seeker without a resume, I want to describe my background incrementally so I can use Job Ranger without first creating a traditional resume.

Implementation provenance: #82/#84.

#### US-3 — Goal-first onboarding

As a user who knows what I want but has not entered my history yet, I want to start with target work and constraints so Job Ranger can begin helping immediately.

Implementation provenance: #82/#83.

### Describe what I want

#### US-4 — Multiple career targets

As a job seeker pursuing more than one career direction, I want separate target tracks so Job Ranger does not mix incompatible goals.

Implementation provenance: #83.

#### US-5 — Hard constraints vs preferences

As a job seeker, I want to distinguish requirements from preferences so Job Ranger does not reject a good opportunity because of something I merely prefer.

Implementation provenance: #83.

As someone whose experience is not entirely conventional employment, I want legitimate projects, freelance work, open-source work, volunteer work, military/service experience, portfolios, and other evidence to participate in matching.

Implementation provenance: #84.

#### US-8 — Credentials that matter

As someone in a credentialed field, I want licenses, certifications, clearances, registrations, and eligibility facts represented explicitly rather than flattened into generic skills.

As a user, I want every factual claim to remain traceable to its source and authority state.

Implementation provenance: #84 and the Career Evidence contracts under #59.

#### US-10 — Correct my record

As a user, I want to edit, merge, reject, supersede, and confirm evidence when the imported record is incomplete, duplicated, or wrong.

Implementation provenance: #84 and Career Evidence review/lineage behavior.

Implementation provenance: #65/#88.

#### US-30 — Preserve my career history over time

As a user, I want Job Ranger to maintain an increasingly complete Career Evidence record rather than reconstructing my history from each new resume.

Implementation provenance: Career Evidence architecture, portability, and #88 reconciliation.

## Universal opportunity assessment

Job Ranger does not reduce every opportunity to one opaque universal percentage.

The user-facing assessment separates at least:

- **eligibility/blockers**;
- **evidence coverage**;
- **career-track alignment**;
- **preference/constraint alignment**;
- **unknowns/uncertainty**.

A compact summary is acceptable, but users must be able to inspect the evidence, requirement, constraint, or source limitation behind the conclusion.

## Progressive onboarding

First-run setup supports three valid entry paths:

1. **resume-first** — import an existing artifact and review proposed evidence;
2. **evidence-first/manual** — enter relevant background incrementally without a resume;
3. **goal-first** — define target work and initial constraints, then add evidence later.

Partial profiles are valid product states. Job Ranger becomes more useful as information is added rather than refusing to work until a large form is complete.

## Target tracks and constraint semantics

A user may pursue materially different directions at the same time.

A Target Track may contain role concepts, compensation, geography, work mode, employment arrangement, schedule, and other supported preferences.

Preferences distinguish:

- **required** — violating this makes the opportunity unacceptable unless the user changes the requirement;
- **preferred** — meaningful but not automatically disqualifying;
- **target** — aspirational value such as target compensation rather than a hard floor.

Capabilities such as travel, relocation, or sponsorship remain bounded/deferred unless repeated validation shows they deserve first-class core fields.

## Validation model

The implementation program established a version-controlled cross-career validation matrix and synthetic fixtures covering materially different career contexts, including:

- hourly/local work;
- skilled trades;
- licensed healthcare;
- technical/portfolio-heavy work;
- recent graduate/first job;
- senior executive/confidential search;
- career change/transferable skills;
- federal/government employment;
- contract/freelance work;
- return-to-work/nonlinear history;
- military transition.

These are validation fixtures, not target-market segments or separate product modes.

Future changes that materially affect US-0 through US-30 should update the validation matrix and representative fixtures rather than assuming the completed program can never regress.

## Program completion

The original #81 program is complete.

Completion established that:

- every US-0 through US-30 story is implemented by the current product contract or explicitly bounded/deferred with rationale;
- the validation matrix is version-controlled;
- cross-career fixtures exercise materially different employment/evidence patterns;
- current roadmap/system documentation reflects the resulting architecture.

This document remains normative after program closure. Completing the implementation program did not freeze product evolution; it established the baseline future work must preserve.
