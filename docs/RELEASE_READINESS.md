# Release Readiness Contract

This document defines the minimum evidence required before Job Ranger publishes a new user-installable release.

A merged `main` branch is **not** a release. A passing unit test is **not** a release. Electron Builder being configured for a platform is **not** a release. A release exists only when an immutable version/tag has been validated and published with the artifacts users are actually expected to run.

## Status authority

- **Published GitHub Release**: authority for what users can download.
- **Immutable release tag**: authority for the source used to build a release.
- **`main`**: authority for current merged development, which may be ahead of the published product.
- **Documentation on `main`**: must describe both boundaries honestly.

The current published stable release is **v1.2.0** (`71f9b790a1f456321aee2c783f39f4a6784b83a9`, promoted byte-for-byte from rc.5). It is immutable historical release truth.

Forward releases follow the accepted distribution architecture ([`design/DISTRIBUTION_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./design/DISTRIBUTION_ARCHITECTURE.md)):

- **Supported channels:** the Microsoft Store package (Windows native) and the web/PWA runtime (cross-platform).
- **Advanced/test artifacts:** the direct-download NSIS installer, unless it is independently signed. Azure Artifact Signing is optional and never blocks a release.
- **Not part of the forward architecture:** native macOS and Linux packages.

## Release-blocking checklist

### 1. Scope and version

- [ ] The intended release scope is frozen.
- [ ] Every included pull request is merged to the candidate commit.
- [ ] No known release-blocking issue remains open.
- [ ] The target version has been deliberately selected.
- [ ] `package.json`, release notes, badges/download links, and generated artifact names agree on the selected version where applicable.
- [ ] The immutable candidate tag points to the exact validated commit.

Do not bump versions early merely to create the appearance of release progress.

### 2. Product truth and documentation

- [ ] `README.md` distinguishes shipped behavior from newer candidate/`main` behavior correctly.
- [ ] `HELP.md` matches the actual user interface and workflows in the candidate.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has a complete candidate entry derived from the `Unreleased` section.
- [ ] `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md` matches the candidate architecture and capabilities.
- [ ] `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` matches the candidate service and trust boundaries.
- [ ] `docs/planning/PLAN.md` contains only genuine next/deferred work.
- [ ] `docs/README.md` correctly classifies current, design, validation, research, and historical documents.
- [ ] `SECURITY.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` remain accurate.
- [ ] User-visible limitations and deferrals are stated rather than hidden.

Documentation drift is a release blocker because users and contributors otherwise cannot tell what software they are evaluating.

### 3. Data and migration safety

- [ ] Upgrade from the latest published release is exercised against a representative existing data directory.
- [ ] All SQLite migrations apply successfully and idempotently.
- [ ] Career Profile, Career Evidence, Applications, source state, resume artifacts, lifecycle state, Career Stories, insights, and settings remain readable after upgrade.
- [ ] Managed artifact paths resolve after upgrade.
- [ ] Backup creation succeeds before destructive/manual migration testing.
- [ ] Backup validation detects tampering/corruption.
- [ ] Restore into a different data root is exercised and managed paths rebase correctly.
- [ ] A staged restore is not allowed to destroy the only known-good live copy before the restored database initializes successfully.

### 4. Security and dependency review

- [ ] Current dependency audit is reviewed.
- [ ] Any vulnerability exception is narrow, documented, and limited to the exact dependency/path/risk that cannot yet be remediated.
- [ ] Renderer/main-process boundaries remain `nodeIntegration: false`, `contextIsolation: true`, and `webSecurity: true` where required.
- [ ] Main renderer sandboxing remains enabled.
- [ ] Specialized hidden browser/render surfaces retain their restricted settings.
- [ ] External navigation remains validated.
- [ ] Automated acquisition rejects loopback, link-local, and private-network destinations and binds approved hostname resolution to the actual connection so DNS rebinding cannot silently change the destination.
- [ ] Imported career documents remain untrusted input and do not silently trigger hosted OCR/inference.
- [ ] No new telemetry, sync, inference, credential, or cloud transmission exists without explicit governance and user disclosure.

### 5. Repository validation

An immutable release candidate needs explicit repository validation evidence.

Minimum repository validation:

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run test
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e
```

`npm run repo:health` may be used as the combined type/build/backend gate. Do not claim a command passed if the environment could not execute it.

For documentation-only remediation, code tests may reuse fresh evidence from the unchanged executable candidate commit, but documentation-specific validation must still be performed.

### 6. Documentation validation

- [ ] Markdown links among current source-of-truth documents resolve.
- [ ] No current document describes completed work as planned.
- [ ] No current document claims unreleased candidate/`main` functionality is shipped.
- [ ] References to issues/PRs use the correct completion state.
- [ ] No current document points users to removed runtime files or obsolete commands.
- [ ] Historical plans are unmistakably historical from the documentation index.
- [ ] Screens/workspace names in HELP match current navigation.

### 7. Windows direct-download (NSIS) package validation — advanced/test channel

- [ ] Build from the immutable release tag on the supported Windows builder.
- [ ] NSIS x64 installer is produced with the expected versioned filename.
- [ ] Official pinned SQLite CLI archive is downloaded and its published SHA3-256 verified.
- [ ] Packaged `resources/sqlite3.exe` exists and executes.
- [ ] With `SQLITE3_PATH` removed, runtime resolution selects the packaged SQLite binary.
- [ ] Generated `electron-runtime` entry point exists in the packaged application.
- [ ] The packaged `Job Ranger.exe` executes the headless package-smoke harness from its own `app.asar` using an isolated data root.
- [ ] `windows-package-smoke.json` reports `passed` for the required non-software scenario and is included in release evidence.
- [ ] The Windows trust verifier executes successfully in the native release runner.
- [ ] Installer launch/upgrade is exercised on a clean supported Windows system before stable publication.
- [ ] Existing user data survives installer upgrade.
- [ ] If (and only if) the direct installer is promoted as an ordinary-user channel, it carries valid Authenticode signatures and observed SmartScreen / Smart App Control behavior is recorded on a clean supported machine. Otherwise its release manifest marks it `testerOnly` and release notes label it an advanced/test artifact.
- [ ] A GitHub artifact attestation exists for the installer.

### 7a. Microsoft Store package validation (supported Windows channel)

Design and procedure: [`design/MICROSOFT_STORE_PACKAGING.md`](./design/MICROSOFT_STORE_PACKAGING.md).

- [ ] `windows-store-package` workflow passed for the release commit:
  - `windows-store-package.json`: identity, version, capabilities exactly `runFullTrust` + `internetClient`, no extensions, canonical assets, bundled `sqlite3.exe`;
  - `windows-store-package-smoke.json`: in-package healthcare Career Ops smoke, `windowsStore: true`, isolated data root, Chromium PDF and native parseability, archive round trip;
  - `windows-store-install.json`: data in package storage, no leak into `%APPDATA%`, historical NSIS data unchanged, uninstall behavior.
- [ ] Partner Center identity variables are configured and the submission package was built with `JOB_RANGER_REQUIRE_STORE_IDENTITY=1`.
- [ ] The `.appx`, its checksums, `windows-store-release-manifest.json`, and its artifact attestation are attached to the release.
- [ ] Partner Center certification passed (record the submission ID).
- [ ] A clean supported Windows 11 install from the Store listing, first launch, an upgrade from an earlier Store version, and backup/restore are recorded.
- [ ] README/HELP direct Windows users to the Store **only after** the listing is live.

### 7b. Web/PWA validation (supported cross-platform channel)

Design and procedure: [`design/PWA_RUNTIME.md`](./design/PWA_RUNTIME.md).

- [ ] The `pwa` workflow passed for the release commit: production build, web-parser benchmark, and the browser suite (Career Ops end to end, Electron↔PWA portability, rejected backups, offline shell, verified/rejected updates, quota failure, tab lock).
- [ ] `job-ranger-web-v<version>.zip`, `web-build-info.json` (build ID, commit, CSP, asset hashes), the browser-suite report, checksums, the release manifest, and the artifact attestation are attached to the release.
- [ ] Deployment uses `deploy-pwa.yml` from the attested archive (no rebuild), behind the protected `production-web` environment, to an HTTPS origin that serves the shipped `_headers`.
- [ ] The post-deploy check confirms the live build ID and security headers.
- [ ] The browser/platform matrix is recorded from real validation: Chromium-based browsers on Windows, macOS, and Linux; Firefox; Safari, including install/standalone behavior where supported.
- [ ] Storage persistence and eviction guidance, and known web limitations, are visible in the app and HELP.
- [ ] README/HELP link the production origin **only after** it is live.

### 8. macOS package validation (historical/manual only)

Native macOS distribution is not part of the forward architecture. The release workflow builds macOS packages only on explicit manual dispatch. The checklist below applies only if such a build is published:

For both x64 and arm64:

- [ ] Build from the immutable release tag.
- [ ] Expected DMG/ZIP artifacts are produced.
- [ ] Generated Electron runtime entry point is present.
- [ ] Both packaged executable architectures are verified from the unpacked build output.
- [ ] The native hosted-runner packaged executable executes the headless package-smoke harness from its own `app.asar` using an isolated data root.
- [ ] `macos-package-smoke.json` reports `passed` for the required non-software scenario and is included in release evidence.
- [ ] SQLite resolution works in the packaged application.
- [ ] The macOS trust verifier executes successfully in the native release runner.
- [ ] A stable public release is Developer ID signed, notarized, stapled, and passes `codesign`, `spctl`, and stapler verification.
- [ ] The signed/notarized application launches on a clean supported macOS system under Gatekeeper before stable publication.

### 9. Product smoke validation

Release automation must exercise a deterministic packaged consumer spine using a materially non-software scenario. The package-smoke harness validates:

1. fresh isolated local data initialization;
2. Career Profile creation;
3. Target Track creation;
4. user-authored Career Evidence;
5. pasted evidence/source-artifact persistence;
6. employer and filter persistence;
7. preserved full job-source snapshot;
8. requirement extraction/evidence coverage;
9. application tracking/status persistence;
10. JSON Resume export;
11. backup creation and validation;
12. persistence counts after the workflow completes.

This hosted packaged smoke is release-blocking and its machine-readable report must exist before the release manifest can be generated.

It does **not** replace final clean-machine acceptance for behavior that depends on the operating system's trust/user-interaction layer. Before stable publication, record real installation/launch behavior for the signed Windows build and the signed/notarized macOS build. Human UI acceptance may reuse current Electron E2E evidence where the candidate UI code is unchanged, but any candidate-specific UI defect or installer interaction must be exercised directly.

### 10. Clean-machine public trust validation

The supported channels must be tested as ordinary users receive them:
- **Microsoft Store:** a Store-delivered install on a clean supported Windows 11 system (see 7a).
- **Web app:** the production origin in real browsers (see 7b).

The evidence below applies to directly downloaded native binaries that are promoted as ordinary-user channels.

Windows evidence must include:

- artifact SHA-256 and valid Authenticode result;
- signer subject/issuer;
- Windows version/architecture;
- SmartScreen / Smart App Control state and observed behavior;
- normal install result;
- normal first-launch result.

macOS evidence must include:

- artifact SHA-256;
- `codesign --verify --deep --strict` result;
- Gatekeeper `spctl` assessment;
- stapler validation;
- macOS version/build/architecture;
- normal install and first-launch result under Gatekeeper.

Use `docs/CLEAN_MACHINE_TRUST_VALIDATION.md` and the platform verifier scripts. Do not globally weaken platform security to force a passing result.

### 11. Release publication

- [ ] Release title and notes describe only behavior present in the tag.
- [ ] Windows and macOS assets have completed upload before the release is presented as complete.
- [ ] Each platform release manifest references both trust evidence and packaged-smoke evidence.
- [ ] Every released artifact has a GitHub artifact attestation (`gh attestation verify <file> --repo Knapp-Kevin/job-ranger`).
- [ ] Download links in the root README are updated only after assets exist.
- [ ] Changelog release date/version is finalized.
- [ ] `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md` moves candidate features from implemented/candidate to shipped only after publication.
- [ ] Post-release install/download is spot-checked from the actual GitHub Release page.

## Evidence record

Each release should record:

- tag and commit SHA;
- validation date;
- validator/environment;
- commands executed;
- package/artifact names;
- platform results;
- packaged-smoke report for each supported platform;
- signing/notarization trust evidence;
- clean-machine trust/launch observations;
- migrations tested from which prior version;
- known limitations or waived checks and rationale;
- links to retained validation evidence.

## Current v1.2.0 release-readiness status

**Published:** `v1.2.0` → `71f9b790a1f456321aee2c783f39f4a6784b83a9` on 2026-10-05.

The release is non-prerelease and GitHub's current latest release. Its Windows/macOS assets are byte-identical to the validated rc.5 packages and include packaged smoke, trust-state, checksum, and release-manifest evidence. v1.2.0 was published under an explicit owner-approved unsigned/unnotarized exception. Forward distribution moved to the Microsoft Store (#125) and the web/PWA runtime (#130). Any change ships as a new release; v1.2.0 is never mutated.
