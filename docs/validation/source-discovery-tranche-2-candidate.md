# Discovery Provider Tranche #136: Himalayas Candidate

**Status:** exploratory implementation only, isolated `wip/136-himalayas-discovery-unqualified`, **not on main, not shipped, not Qortara-qualified**.  
**Plan:** `docs/plans/136-provider-expansion.md`.  
**Existing stable boundary:** `docs/validation/source-discovery-tranche-1.md`.  
**Verified provider documentation, 2026-10-09:** https://himalayas.app/docs/remote-jobs-api, https://himalayas.app/api, https://himalayas.app/docs/openapi.json .

## Candidate functionality

- Job Ranger's public-feed source-discovery seam now includes bounded, role-specific Himalayas search requests (at most the first three target role titles, one first-page request per title).
- Validated listings retain source attribution and a URL on Himalayas, not an invented direct application URL. The UI's existing **Found via Himalayas** and **Open opportunity** controls supply source name and backlink.
- Job location represents provider restrictions explicitly: worldwide only when both geography and time-zone lists are explicitly empty. Missing location data stays **eligibility unspecified** rather than fabricated as unrestricted remote.
- Listings remain *opportunity-only*. They never become monitorable employers merely because the upstream provider returns a listing. Existing monitored-source approval is unchanged.
- Responses with missing or hostile URLs are discarded. An invalid response, HTTP 429, or browser policy block produces provider-specific warnings while other feeds remain available.
- Results are deterministically interleaved by provider before applying the user's result cap, so large legacy feed responses cannot silently crowd out new relevant providers. This does not establish a real-world improvement in unique coverage; that needs measured fixtures.
- The browser/PWA explicitly skips Himalayas with a CORS warning, because the official API disallows direct browser requests. No proxy, CORS bypass, personal-data upload, or mandatory credentials have been added.

## Limits

- This is **not** a general Himalayas integration, all-market crawl, or candidate application API; it uses the public search endpoint only.
- The first three role queries, first pages, and user-visible `partial` coverage are deliberately bounded. The provider's job inventory is refreshed daily. More frequent polling cannot create fresher jobs.
- The job API requires a visible backlink and source credit. Job Ranger must not syndicate these jobs to third-party aggregators.
- We Work Remotely remains a **separate second phase**, contingent on safe RSS parsing, terms compliance, actual PWA access, and tested unique value. https://weworkremotely.com/remote-job-rss-feed
- No live duplicate/unique-coverage measurement against Remote OK and Arbeitnow has been completed; **#136 must stay open** until measured and either implemented with evidence or explicitly rejected/deferred.
- Qortara formal plan gate, independent audit, intent lock and final seal are not established. No production claim is made.

## Test contract

`tests/himalayas-discovery.test.cjs`: isolated synthetic fixtures assert payload validation, URL and GUID integrity, deterministic role filtering, geographic and timezone restrictions, attribution, rate-limit failure isolation, request cap, and browser skip.

`tests/e2e/source-discovery.spec.ts`: mock first-party listings appear in the discovery UI with attribution, visible eligibility and no approval action for provider-only opportunities.

**CI evidence:** not established until exact-head workflow results are independently observed. Green source-contract tests do not prove provider availability or PWA parity.

## We Work Remotely RSS phase-2 implementation candidate (dependent WIP)

- First-party source: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-job-rss-feed; all-jobs feed at https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs.rss.
- WWR's RSS page expressly allows use of the public feed with attribution. Its separate https://weworkremotely.com/api-terms-and-guidelines restricts job-search services and bypassing its application interface. **This unresolved terms-scope conflict is a release blocker**, not a grant of broader rights.
- Candidate fetches only one first-party HTTPS RSS feed with a strict byte limit, publisher-only redirects, timeout, and denial of DTD/entity declarations. No page scraping, new library, API key, or external proxy.
- Normalizer accepts valid RSS 2.0 item elements with title as Employer: Position, direct publisher link, date, region, country, type and description; ignores headquarters state. Rejects unsafe/offsite links, unsupported entities, malformed nesting, duplicate listing links and oversize feeds.
- Location prefers country over potentially misleading broad region; missing country plus Anywhere in the World yields **eligibility unspecified** rather than invented unrestricted access.
- Every result remains an opportunity-only lead. The existing per-provider result interleaving prevents monopolization of the limit.
- PWA browser CORS is **unverified**; this feed is skipped there with a warning. No cloud proxy, CORS bypass or silent feature-parity claim.
- Not shipped or Qortara-qualified. Pending: complete exact-head suites; live RSS schema/size check; terms signoff; independent source security review; measured incremental employer/title/eligibility coverage vs Remote OK, Arbeitnow and Himalayas.

### Regression cases

`tests/wwr-discovery.test.cjs` covers CDATA, entities, invalid XML and DTDs, offsite links, duplicate jobs, field projection, country restrictions, redirect host and size boundaries, HTTP 429, runtime skip and independent failure isolation. The Electron source-discovery E2E fixture asserts attribution and no source approval.

No live provider availability, legal permission or employment eligibility is inferred from synthetic test successes.
