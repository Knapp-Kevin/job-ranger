# Documentation Index

Job Ranger documentation is intentionally divided into **current product truth**, **active design/roadmap**, **validation evidence**, **research**, **release evidence**, and **historical provenance**.

This hierarchy exists because the repository has accumulated multiple generations of planning documents. A reader should never have to guess whether an old phase plan still describes the product.

## Authority hierarchy

When documents disagree, use this order:

1. **Published GitHub Release** for what ordinary users can download and run.
2. **Current source and tests on `main`** for what is actually implemented in the repository.
3. **`SYSTEM_STATE.md`** for the reconciled factual snapshot of `main` versus the published release.
4. **Root `README.md` and `HELP.md`** for public/user-facing product behavior.
5. **`ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md`** for current architecture and accepted trust boundaries.
6. **`planning/PLAN.md`** for genuine next work.
7. **Current design documents** for normative contracts and accepted architectural decisions.
8. **Validation/research documents** for evidence and alternatives.
9. **Historical plans / internal provenance** for how the project got here, not what it is now.

A stale plan does not outrank merged code merely because it contains more checkboxes.

## Current product/design contracts

These describe implemented architecture or accepted long-lived contracts and should remain aligned with `SYSTEM_STATE.md`:

- [`design/UNIVERSAL_USER_STORIES.md`](./design/UNIVERSAL_USER_STORIES.md)
- [`design/CAREER_EVIDENCE_PERSISTENCE_CONTRACT.md`](./design/CAREER_EVIDENCE_PERSISTENCE_CONTRACT.md)
- [`design/CAREER_EVIDENCE_RESUME_FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN.md`](./design/CAREER_EVIDENCE_RESUME_FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN.md)
- [`design/APPLICATION_LIFECYCLE_FOUNDATION.md`](./design/APPLICATION_LIFECYCLE_FOUNDATION.md)
- [`design/INTERVIEW_PREP.md`](./design/INTERVIEW_PREP.md)
- [`design/CAREER_STORIES.md`](./design/CAREER_STORIES.md)
- [`design/APPLICATION_MATERIALS.md`](./design/APPLICATION_MATERIALS.md)
- [`design/SEARCH_LEARNING.md`](./design/SEARCH_LEARNING.md)
- [`design/BACKUP_RESTORE.md`](./design/BACKUP_RESTORE.md)
- [`design/R5_PORTABILITY_SCOPE_DECISIONS.md`](./design/R5_PORTABILITY_SCOPE_DECISIONS.md)
- [`design/DISTRIBUTION_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./design/DISTRIBUTION_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [`design/PWA_RUNTIME.md`](./design/PWA_RUNTIME.md)
- [`design/MICROSOFT_STORE_PACKAGING.md`](./design/MICROSOFT_STORE_PACKAGING.md)

A design document may preserve detailed implementation rationale even after its issue closes. Its status must not be used to infer whether a feature is shipped; use `SYSTEM_STATE.md` and the release record for that.

## Validation evidence

Version-controlled validation evidence lives under [`validation/`](./validation/).

Current areas include:

- universal career fixture schema/version/execution/findings;
- US-0 through US-30 validation matrix;
- structured credential evidence validation;
- evidence references/lineage validation;
- source discovery tranche validation;
- Windows package/runtime evidence where retained.

Validation documents answer **what was proven and under what assumptions**. They do not automatically upgrade a feature from implemented to shipped.

## Research evidence

Research documents are inputs to product and architecture decisions, not a feature adoption queue.

Key current research:

- [`research/AUTO_APPLY_MARKET_RESEARCH_2026-10-04.md`](./research/AUTO_APPLY_MARKET_RESEARCH_2026-10-04.md) — delegated/automated submission market evidence and the rationale for Job Ranger's quality-over-quantity Career Ops direction;
- [`research/RESUME_INTELLIGENCE_QOR.md`](./research/RESUME_INTELLIGENCE_QOR.md)
- [`research/RESUME_INTELLIGENCE_CATALOG_HARVEST.md`](./research/RESUME_INTELLIGENCE_CATALOG_HARVEST.md)
- [`research/JOB_RANGER_CAPABILITY_CATALOG_RECONCILIATION.md`](./research/JOB_RANGER_CAPABILITY_CATALOG_RECONCILIATION.md)
- [`research/RESUME_PARSER_ADOPTION_2026-09-25.md`](./research/RESUME_PARSER_ADOPTION_2026-09-25.md)
- [`research/ANYDOC_PARSER_BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL.md`](./research/ANYDOC_PARSER_BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL.md)

Research can recommend or reject a capability. It does not make that capability product truth until accepted and implemented.

## Release documentation

Release truth is deliberately strict:

- GitHub Releases define what users can download;
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) records release history and the next unreleased delta;
- [`RELEASE_READINESS.md`](./RELEASE_READINESS.md) defines the pre-publication evidence required;
- package/build configuration defines what can theoretically be built, not what was actually published;
- platform validation records what was actually exercised.

The latest published stable release is **v1.2.0**, published 2026-10-05 from commit `71f9b790a1f456321aee2c783f39f4a6784b83a9`.

The accepted post-v1.2 distribution direction does not retroactively change v1.2.0. The historical release remains immutable; Store/PWA work is implemented on the post-v1.2.0 line (PR #142) and remains forward-looking until certified or deployed.

## Current documentation baseline

As of the October 2026 reconciliation, current docs must reflect that the v1.2 line includes:

- progressive onboarding;
- Target Tracks and explicit constraint semantics;
- durable Career Profile and Applications;
- Career Evidence import/direct authoring/provenance/lineage;
- structured credentials and evidence references;
- source discovery with explicit approval;
- explainable opportunity assessment;
- deterministic resume creation and tailoring;
- exact submitted-artifact history;
- lifecycle contacts/events/reminders/offers;
- evidence-grounded interview preparation;
- Career Stories;
- evidence-grounded application materials;
- Search Insights and recurring-gap analysis;
- verified backup/restore;
- JSON Resume interoperability;
- cross-career validation fixtures.

Current product documentation must also preserve the accepted strategic distinction that Job Ranger is a **quality-over-quantity Career Ops product**. It may automate discovery, analysis, preparation, and organization aggressively while keeping consequential external actions intentional. Candidate relationship-path features tracked in #121 remain historical design context unless separately implemented.

Current architecture documentation must preserve the accepted post-v1.2 distribution direction:

- cross-platform mainstream through a local-first PWA/web runtime;
- Windows-native mainstream through Microsoft Store packaging/certification;
- no required Azure Artifact Signing dependency;
- no planned native macOS distribution or Apple Developer Program dependency;
- no SignPath dependency;
- direct unsigned GitHub native binaries are not the preferred ordinary-user path.

A current source-of-truth document that describes completed capabilities as "planned" is stale and should be corrected. A current source-of-truth document that describes accepted future distribution work as already implemented is equally stale.

## Historical planning records

The following files are retained for implementation provenance and must not be used as current product status:

- `plan-remediation.md`
- `plan-v1-remediation.md`
- `plan-final-remediation.md`
- `plan-phase2-api-adapters.md`
- `plan-phase3-salary-extraction.md`
- `plan-phase4-caching-circuit-breaker.md`
- `planning/plan-phase5-notifications-tray.md`
- `planning/plan-phase5-notifications-tray-v2.md`

These documents are not rewritten merely to make history look tidy. Where they conflict with current source, tests, or current source-of-truth documents, the newer evidence wins.

## Internal provenance artifacts

`META_LEDGER.md` and `SHADOW_GENOME.md` are internal project/provenance artifacts.

They are not end-user product documentation and must not override current product, governance, security, architecture, or release truth.

## Documentation maintenance rule

Material product changes should update the smallest set of current source-of-truth documents needed to prevent contradiction.

Before a release:

- run the documentation/release-readiness reconciliation;
- verify HELP/navigation language against the actual candidate UI;
- move completed work out of roadmap "planned" sections;
- ensure `Unreleased` changelog content covers the actual candidate;
- verify shipped vs main labels;
- record any validation that could not be performed.

The repository intentionally preserves GitHub Actions budget. Documentation-only or release-readiness remediation may be validated manually by the maintainer instead of through hosted Actions, provided the evidence states exactly what was and was not run.
