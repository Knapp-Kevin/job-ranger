# Changelog

All notable user-facing, architecture, governance, and maintenance changes should be recorded here.

## Unreleased

Release-candidate preparation for v1.3.0 is active. Changes after the candidate freeze belong here until they are deliberately admitted to the release.

### Fixed

- **Web app built on Windows**: every action failed with `No handler registered for '<channel>'`. The build plugin handed the bundler backslash module ids, so the web runtime worker contained two copies of its IPC handler registry. Adapter imports now resolve through the bundler's own resolver, and a check on the built bundle guards against a second copy. Builds made on Linux, including the production web build, were not affected.
- **Web app layout**: the web app shipped without Tailwind layout styles on every platform (colors and fonts loaded, but the sidebar, cards, and grids were unstyled). Tailwind scanned only the web build's `web/` folder, not the components in `src/`. The shared stylesheet now names the repository root as Tailwind's source, and a check on the built stylesheet guards the app shell's layout classes. The desktop app was not affected.
- **Release upgrade verification on Windows**: `npm run test:release-upgrade` failed with `no such table` because Windows `sqlite3.exe` output ends lines with CRLF.

### Changed

- CI runs the web browser suite and the release upgrade verification on Windows as well as Ubuntu.
- Both web browser-suite CI jobs upload Playwright traces and screenshots when a test fails. The service-worker update test no longer races the browser's own update check.

## v1.3.0 - Release candidate

Not yet published. Candidate evidence: [`docs/validation/RELEASE_CANDIDATE_V1.3.0.md`](./docs/validation/RELEASE_CANDIDATE_V1.3.0.md).

Implements the accepted distribution architecture (Microsoft Store + local-first web/PWA runtime; #125, #130). Nothing below is shipped yet. The Store channel awaits Partner Center certification. The web app runs today as a local self-hosted install at `http://localhost:4174`; a public production deployment is deliberately deferred until there is demand for external distribution (#145). Validation evidence: [`docs/validation/DISTRIBUTION_IMPLEMENTATION_2026-10-05.md`](./docs/validation/DISTRIBUTION_IMPLEMENTATION_2026-10-05.md).

### Added

- **Web/PWA runtime** (#130): Job Ranger runs in modern desktop browsers on the same shared application core as the desktop app.
  - SQLite WASM persisted to the origin-private file system with atomic writes; a single-writer tab lock.
  - Browser DOCX/PDF resume import.
  - Deterministic ATS PDF generation through the same Truth Gate and Parseability Gate as the desktop app.
  - Resume PDFs in Latin extended, Vietnamese, Greek, Cyrillic, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, set in embedded Noto fonts. The fonts are downloaded only when a resume needs them, verified, and then cached for offline use. Right-to-left and Indic scripts fail export with an explanation and remain served by the Windows app.
  - Strict Content Security Policy with Trusted Types and an explicit job-feed origin allowlist.
  - An installable manifest and an integrity-verified offline app shell with user-confirmed updates and repair.
  - Visible storage-quota and persistence handling.
- **Portable `.jobranger` backups**: a single file moves data between the Windows app and the web app in either direction. It is validated (CRC-32, SHA-256, safe paths, version and schema checks) before anything is replaced. v1.2.0 backup folders remain restorable in the desktop app via their `manifest.json`.
- **Microsoft Store packaging** (#125): AppX package of the existing Electron app (electron-builder v26).
  - Partner Center identity comes from repository configuration.
  - Narrow capabilities (`runFullTrust`, `internetClient`).
  - Canonical Store tile assets.
  - An isolated Store data root with correct Explorer paths.
  - An explicit, read-only import of data from an earlier desktop installation.
  - No app-managed updater (the Store services updates).
- **Local self-hosting of the web app** (#145, #147, #149): `npm run selfhost:pwa` builds and serves the production web app at the fixed origin `http://localhost:4174`. A busy port fails with an explanation instead of silently moving to another port, because browser storage is tied to the exact origin. README documents the persistent dogfood path and the `.jobranger` backup-before-upgrade rule.
- Settings → **This installation**: channel, version/build, data location, persistent-storage status and request, web limitations, app-shell repair, and Store desktop-data import.
- CI and release workflows:
  - `windows-store-package`: builds the AppX, verifies the manifest, installs it, and runs the non-software Career Ops smoke inside the package context;
  - `pwa`: build, web-parser benchmark, and browser suite;
  - `deploy-pwa`: verified, attested, environment-gated deployment of a released web build;
  - GitHub artifact attestations for released artifacts.
  - `release-upgrade` CI job (`npm run test:release-upgrade`): builds the latest published release, writes data with its own smoke tests, and verifies that the current build opens that data without changing it, applies every migration, and backs it up and restores it.

### Changed

- **License:** development after v1.2.0 is licensed under **AGPL-3.0-only**. v1.2.0 and earlier releases keep their MIT grants. See [`LICENSE_HISTORY.md`](./LICENSE_HISTORY.md) and the new [`TRADEMARKS.md`](./TRADEMARKS.md).
- Azure Artifact Signing is opt-in for direct-download Windows builds (`JOB_RANGER_REQUIRE_WINDOWS_SIGNING`). Unsigned direct installers are labelled tester-only in their release manifest instead of blocking a release.
- Native macOS packages are built only on manual dispatch. macOS users are served by the web app going forward.
- Job Ranger refuses to open data upgraded by a newer database schema instead of running older code against it.
- Backup validation checks migrations against everything the current build knows, not only those the live database has applied.
- The UI no longer requests remote Google Fonts (the desktop CSP already blocked them).
- The IPC handler table and SQL literal encoding moved into shared modules used by both runtimes.

### Fixed

- The Parseability Gate compared only ASCII letters and digits, so a PDF that lost Chinese, Cyrillic, Greek, or accented text could still pass. It now verifies Unicode text in both runtimes. Right-to-left and Indic content, which PDF parsers extract inconsistently, is reported as an advisory to check manually instead of being silently ignored.
- The Truth Gate's unsupported-edit check compared only ASCII letters and digits, and it ignored one-character tokens (#143). Edited resume statements could therefore add unsupported claims in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, Thai, or accented Latin text, or change a single-digit number ("5 engineers" → "9 engineers"), and still pass. These edits are now flagged, and English checking is otherwise unchanged. See the trade-offs in [`CAREER_EVIDENCE_RESUME_FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN.md` §12.1.1](./docs/design/CAREER_EVIDENCE_RESUME_FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN.md).
- After a scrape finished, the idle scrape queue could still read the database. That read raced shutdown and produced an unhandled "unable to open database" error.
- Greenhouse job descriptions (entity-escaped HTML from the Greenhouse API) are now unescaped before requirement extraction, so requirements are detected individually instead of as one block.

## v1.2.0 - 2026-10-05

v1.2.0 is the stable public release, promoted from immutable `v1.2.0-rc.5` at `71f9b790a1f456321aee2c783f39f4a6784b83a9`. The Windows/macOS artifacts are byte-identical to the rc.5 packages that passed packaged-runtime smoke, native trust-verifier execution, SHA-256 verification, and schema-v2 release-manifest generation. The release is intentionally unsigned/unnotarized under an explicit owner-approved exception.

### Added

- Progressive first-run onboarding with resume-first, no-resume, and goal-first entry paths.
- Multiple Target Tracks with required/preferred/target semantics for supported search constraints.
- Durable SQLite-backed Career Profile and Applications state.
- Canonical Career Evidence with provenance, authority state, correction, merge/reject/supersede lineage, structured credentials, references, and direct user authoring.
- Resume import for DOCX, text-bearing PDF, plain text, and pasted text with source preservation, hashing, extraction snapshots, duplicate detection, and explicit OCR-required/failure states.
- Canonical job-source snapshots with source URL, retrieval time, hashes, completeness state, extraction/version metadata, dedupe, and changed-content history.
- Source reliability diagnostics that distinguish success-empty, cooldown/circuit, unsupported/browser-unavailable, network-policy, access-denied, rate-limit, timeout/retrieval, extraction, parser, and unclassified failures.
- Deterministic job requirement normalization and requirement-to-evidence mapping with direct, transferable, ambiguous, and gap states tied to the preserved source text used for analysis.
- Multi-dimensional opportunity assessment covering eligibility, evidence coverage, career alignment, preference alignment, blockers, and unknowns.
- Consumer source discovery behind a provider-neutral seam with explicit user approval before monitoring discovered sources.
- Deterministic resume creation with ATS-oriented templates, Truth Gate, isolated Chromium PDF rendering, Parseability Gate, versioned artifacts, diffs, and exact application linkage.
- Deterministic target-specific resume tailoring with preserved evidence provenance.
- Application lifecycle contacts, milestones, follow-up events, reminders, and exact submitted-resume history.
- Evidence-linked Career Stories.
- Evidence-grounded interview preparation that distinguishes exact submitted evidence, later-corrected/superseded evidence, additional confirmed evidence, and real gaps.
- Versioned evidence-grounded application materials that become visibly stale when supporting Career Evidence changes.
- Structured target-track attribution, offer/negotiation state, recurring-gap analysis, observed outcome summaries, and Search Insights.
- Verified portable backup and staged restore with artifact integrity checks and cross-data-root path rebasing.
- JSON Resume import/export as a bounded interoperability adapter without making JSON Resume canonical product state.
- Universal cross-career validation fixtures, including hourly/local, healthcare, trades, executive, recent graduate, federal/government, contractor/freelance, career-change, return-to-work, and military-transition contexts.
- Connection-pinned HTTP/HTTPS acquisition transport with per-hop redirect approval and deterministic DNS-rebinding regression coverage.
- Stable-release platform-trust gates for Windows Azure Artifact Signing and macOS Developer ID signing/notarization/stapling.
- Per-platform release trust reports, SHA-256 checksum files, and machine-readable release manifests.
- Bounded tester-installation guidance for unsigned prereleases that does not require disabling platform security globally.

### Changed

- Replaced the old universal fit-percentage surface with explainable assessment dimensions rather than presenting one opaque number as product truth.
- Career Profile now owns intent/preferences while Career Evidence owns factual career history.
- Application and resume workflows now preserve exact evidence/artifact history rather than relying on mutable filenames or free-form notes.
- Requirement analysis now uses preserved canonical source text instead of being constrained to the legacy short description snippet.
- Electron privileged implementation authority moved to TypeScript under `electron/src/**`; `electron-runtime/**` is generated for execution and packaging instead of maintaining checked-in compiled copies.
- Repository documentation uses explicit stable / packaged-candidate / implemented / candidate / deferred / historical status language.
- Job Ranger's product direction is explicitly framed as quality-over-quantity Career Ops: understand the person, career direction, companies, people, opportunities, and then applications rather than optimizing raw application throughput.
- Optional remote inference remains deferred because the deterministic product covers core assessment, tailoring, application materials, interview preparation, stories, and insights without requiring it.
- OCR for image-only resumes and DOCX resume export remain explicit deferrals rather than silent fallbacks.
- Arbitrary generic career-site hostnames remain manual-review/non-runnable rather than being automatically promoted into privileged generic acquisition.
- Linux packaging was evaluated and deferred until real demand justifies the support surface.
- Microsoft Store AppX/MSIX distribution was evaluated as a valid post-v1.2.0 candidate but not admitted to the current release scope.

### Security and reliability

- Sandboxed the primary renderer and retained context isolation, disabled Node integration, and web security boundaries.
- Added acquisition-network policy that rejects unsafe loopback, link-local, private-network, and other disallowed destinations.
- Replaced preflight-only DNS approval with connection-level address pinning: sockets connect only to policy-approved public addresses while Host/SNI/TLS verification remains bound to the original hostname.
- Redirects are independently resolved, approved, and pinned per hop.
- Source discovery uses the same pinned transport.
- Isolated Electron scraper HTTP/HTTPS document and subresource traffic is routed through the governed pinned transport.
- Added deterministic regression coverage proving a hostile later DNS answer cannot redirect the direct transport to a private/local destination.
- Hardened privileged IPC numeric ranges, source-vendor hostname classification, managed artifact reveal paths, and record-shape validation.
- Removed duplicate/generated privileged validator implementations and tracked build/test residue so `electron/src/**` remains the checked-in privileged authority.
- Expanded repository-health coverage to exercise salary, scrape-guard, tray-policy, source-truth, DNS-rebinding, distribution-trust, and QOR regressions.
- Hardened SQLite-backed persistence, migration, and E2E locking behavior.
- Made high-severity dependency audit findings fail closed except for narrowly documented upstream-blocked tooling exceptions.
- Added backup integrity validation and staged restore safeguards.
- Stable exact-semver release builds normally fail closed when required Windows signing or macOS signing/notarization configuration/verification is absent. v1.2.0 is the documented owner-approved exception, promoted byte-for-byte from validated rc.5 artifacts with explicit unsigned-distribution warnings.

### Release engineering

- Added generated Electron-runtime build authority and package configuration for `electron-runtime/electron/src/main.cjs`.
- Expanded repository-health and Electron E2E coverage across Career Evidence, targeting, discovery, assessment, source truth, resume lifecycle/tailoring, credentials, application lifecycle, Career Stories, materials, interview prep, insights, backup/restore, interoperability, and hardening regressions.
- Added `docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md` as the release-blocking contract.
- Added `docs/PRODUCT_GAP_REVIEW.md` for candidate/deferred/rejected dispositions.
- Synchronized `package.json` and root `package-lock.json` metadata at v1.2.0.
- Added candidate-specific evidence under `docs/validation/RELEASE_CANDIDATE_V1.2.0.md`.
- Added `docs/DISTRIBUTION_TRUST.md` and `docs/TESTER_INSTALLATION.md`.
- Added Windows and macOS trust-verification scripts.
- Added post-package SHA-256/release-manifest generation that requires the corresponding trust-evidence file to exist.
- Fixed unsigned macOS prerelease packaging so blank/incomplete signing environment variables are removed before electron-builder rather than being misinterpreted as a certificate source.
- `v1.2.0-rc.3` hosted release run `37239803933` completed successfully for Windows x64 and macOS x64/arm64 with expected package/trust/checksum/manifest assets uploaded.

### Post-release distribution trust follow-up

Stable v1.2.0 is published. Real Windows signing and macOS Developer ID/notarization evidence remain tracked under #125/#130 for a signed follow-up release. v1.2.0 artifacts are immutable and must not be replaced in place.

## v1.1.2 - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Restored readable inactive sidebar navigation in the Midnight theme.
- Replaced inert dashboard text styled like links with real contextual navigation to Find Jobs, Companies, and Filters.
- Removed stale Alpha-facing workspace language from the released dashboard.

### Changed

- Removed the HVAC-specific starter and occupation-specific placeholders from primary Career Profile onboarding.
- Reframed role targeting around current, adjacent, and reasonable stretch opportunities across careers.
- Generalized minimum compensation from an hourly-only field to an hourly-or-annual preference.
- Simplified the sidebar brand area by removing the theme description and redundant `Local desktop` pill.

### Compatibility and validation

- Existing v1 Career Profiles preserve their saved hourly minimum through the v2 profile migration.
- Deterministic fit scoring compares listed compensation against the user's selected hourly or annual basis.
- Repository-health validation and Electron E2E cover the updated navigation and Career Profile behavior.
- Dependency audit remains at zero known npm vulnerabilities.

## v1.1.1 - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Made the Windows release self-contained by bundling the official SQLite 3.53.4 x64 command-line runtime used by the desktop backend.
- Updated Windows runtime resolution so packaged builds prefer `resources/sqlite3.exe` before host `PATH` while development still supports `SQLITE3_PATH` or a host install.
- Standardized the published Windows artifact on the NSIS installer target instead of generating two same-named `.exe` targets.

### Release engineering

- Pinned the official SQLite Windows tools archive used by the release workflow.
- Added SHA3-256 verification against SQLite's published digest before extraction.
- Added Windows packaging validation that executes the bundled SQLite binary and proves the runtime resolver selects it with `SQLITE3_PATH` removed.
- Added durable Windows packaging evidence under `docs/windows-package-validation.md`.
- Added SQLite runtime provenance to `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

### Release note

- v1.1.0 successfully produced the macOS x64/arm64 artifacts but its Windows builder exposed the missing-host-SQLite defect before a Windows asset was uploaded.
- v1.1.1 supersedes v1.1.0 as the first complete Windows + macOS release of the v1.1 feature line.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Career Profile onboarding for target roles, location, pay floor, skills, credentials, and work preferences.
- Career Profile role targeting for jobs the user would consider. The first iteration included one occupation-specific starter; v1.1.2 removed that product-level specialization and generalized onboarding across careers.
- Deterministic job-fit scoring with plain-language reasons and concerns derived only from saved profile data and collected listing evidence.
- Applications workspace with Interested, Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected, and Withdrawn states plus local notes.
- Career-Ops lineage and MIT attribution in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- Pull-request CI running clean dependency installation, audit reporting, and the repository-health gate.
- Grouped Dependabot policy for routine non-major production and development dependency updates.
- Canonical Job Ranger brand assets for the repository banner, logo lockup, and social preview.
- Repository governance, contribution, security, code-of-conduct, branding, and documentation-index guidance.

### Changed

- Reorganized primary navigation around the job-seeker workflow: Home, Find Jobs, Applications, Career Profile, then source/filter/settings tools.
- Upgraded Electron from the unsupported 28.x line to supported Electron 44.4.5.
- Raised the development and release Node.js baseline to 22.12.0 or newer.
- Upgraded the build stack to Vite 8 and TypeScript 7.
- Upgraded `@electron/notarize`, `@electron/fuses`, and `concurrently` to Node 22-compatible current lines.
- Migrated the macOS notarization hook across the CommonJS/ESM boundary using dynamic import and removed the obsolete notarization `tool` option.
- Updated TypeScript configuration for TypeScript 7 and Vite side-effect module declarations.
- Reworked public documentation around verified shipped, implemented, planned, and historical states.
- Updated Electron Playwright tests for the current accessible UI and Career Intelligence navigation.
- Consolidated branding assets under `docs/assets/branding/` while preserving `public/ICON.png` as the canonical runtime icon.

### Fixed

- Added a bounded SQLite client timeout to prevent transient concurrent access from failing immediately with `database is locked`.
- Corrected SQLite CLI timeout configuration so timeout setup does not contaminate JSON query output.
- Restored accessible modal semantics and filter-form label/control associations discovered by Electron E2E validation.

### Security

- Completed the accumulated non-major dependency-security remediation without `npm audit fix --force`.
- Eliminated the remaining Electron / `extract-zip` high-severity findings by moving to the supported Electron runtime.
- The v1.1.0 release-prep dependency audit reports zero known npm vulnerabilities.
- Removed obsolete duplicate packaging/notarization scripts and temporary write-capable validation workflows after use.

### Persistence note

- Existing companies, jobs, filters, settings, and scrape history remain SQLite-backed.
- Career Profile and Applications are local in v1.1.0 but currently use renderer-local storage. Moving them behind the SQLite/backend boundary remains planned durability work.

## v1.0.2 - 2026-03-20

- Fixed Electron startup on macOS by resolving `sqlite3` with platform-aware lookup instead of a Windows-only command.
- Hardened tray initialization so a missing or invalid tray icon does not prevent the app from launching.
- Added the Electron runtime and source files required for packaged/runtime consistency in the repository.
- Published Windows x64 and macOS x64/arm64 release artifacts.
