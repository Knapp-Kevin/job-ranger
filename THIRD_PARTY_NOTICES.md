# Third-Party Notices

## career-ops lineage

Job Ranger is an independent project. Some career-search workflow concepts in Job Ranger's career intelligence work were informed by the open-source **career-ops** project by Santiago Fernández de Valderrama.

- Upstream project: `career-ops-hq/career-ops`
- License: MIT
- Relationship: independent project; no endorsement, sponsorship, certification, or official affiliation is implied.
- Branding: Job Ranger does not use the career-ops name as a product name, logo, or "powered by" claim.
- Provenance register: [`docs/legal/CAREER_OPS_PROVENANCE.md`](./docs/legal/CAREER_OPS_PROVENANCE.md) records the mechanism-level lineage classification, current license verification, and the required donor-record rule for future direct reuse.

Where Job Ranger incorporates or adapts code from career-ops, the following MIT notice applies to those portions:

Career-ops also publishes a separate trademark policy covering its project name and brand. Job Ranger's attribution above is descriptive lineage only and is intentionally written to avoid implying an official relationship.

## Anydoc

Job Ranger uses **Anydoc** for local extraction of text-bearing DOCX and PDF resume documents. Job Ranger invokes the packaged parser directly and keeps hosted OCR disabled by default; imported content is preserved and proposed as reviewable career evidence rather than automatically becoming user-confirmed fact.

- Version adopted: `0.2.4`

- Relationship: third-party runtime dependency; no endorsement, sponsorship, or official affiliation is implied.

The following MIT notice applies to Anydoc and its packaged platform-native components:

## SQLite

Job Ranger's packaged Windows release includes the official SQLite command-line shell so normal users do not need to install a separate SQLite executable.

- Project: SQLite
- Distribution source: `sqlite.org`
- Bundled Windows release line: SQLite 3.53.4 x64 command-line shell
- Status: SQLite's authors dedicate the SQLite deliverable code to the public domain; no SQLite license is required for redistribution of the bundled executable.
- Release integrity: the Windows release workflow downloads the pinned official tools archive and verifies its published SHA3-256 digest before extracting `sqlite3.exe`.

SQLite is a separate project. Its inclusion does not imply endorsement of Job Ranger by the SQLite authors or Hwaci.

## Web/PWA runtime components

The web/PWA build (`dist-pwa/`) bundles the following third-party components. They are not part of the Electron desktop package, which continues to use the bundled SQLite CLI and Anydoc. Each is used unmodified, as distributed on npm, and runs locally in the user's browser. No component sends data to a hosted service.

| Component | Version | License | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm` (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly with the SQLite project's JavaScript API) | 3.53.4-build2 | SQLite: public domain ("May you do good and not evil" blessing). npm wrapper: Apache-2.0 | Local database engine (origin-private file system) |
| `pdfjs-dist` (Mozilla PDF.js) | 6.4.299 | Apache-2.0 | Local text extraction from user-selected PDFs and from generated resume PDFs (Parseability Gate) |
| `pdf-lib` | 1.17.1 | MIT. Includes `@pdf-lib/standard-fonts` (MIT; standard-14 font metrics), `@pdf-lib/upng` (MIT), `pako` (MIT AND Zlib), `tslib` (0BSD) | Deterministic ATS resume PDF writing |
| `fflate` | 0.8.3 | MIT | Bounded local unzip of DOCX documents; deterministic web release archive packaging (build time) |
| `@pdf-lib/fontkit` | 1.1.1 | MIT. Its distributed bundle inlines `restructure`, `unicode-trie`, `unicode-properties`, `dfa`, `clone`, `base64-arraybuffer`, a Brotli decoder (Google), and Node.js `util` code, all MIT. Depends on `pako` (MIT AND Zlib) | Font parsing and subsetting for resume PDFs with text outside Windows-1252 (loaded only when needed) |
| Noto Sans, Noto Sans Thai, Noto Sans SC / TC / JP / KR (via `@fontsource/noto-sans*` 5.3.0) | 5.3.0 | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | Embedded, subset fonts in web-generated resume PDFs. License texts ship with the fonts as `fonts/LICENSE-<family>.txt` |
| `wawoff2` (build time only, not shipped) | 2.0.1 | MIT | Converts the WOFF2 font slices to TrueType during the web build |

License texts ship in `node_modules/<package>/LICENSE*` where the package provides them. The SIL OFL 1.1 permits embedding and redistributing the Noto fonts in documents and with software; the fonts are not sold on their own and keep their reserved names. `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm` declares Apache-2.0 in its `package.json`, and the SQLite core it embeds is public domain. The Apache-2.0 components adopted here include no `NOTICE` files that need reproducing. Re-check both when upgrading.

Relationship: third-party dependencies only; no endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation is implied.
